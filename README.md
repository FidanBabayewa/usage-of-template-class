# usage-of-template-class

Create an IntervalVector template class, which stores the number of unsigned integers of
an interval. It has two template arguments: MIN and MAX. These specify the interval in which
the class stores the number of elements. Assume that MIN will always be less than or equal to
MAX. Example: if we instantiate a variable like this: IntervalVector<1,3> iv;, initially it
will store zero 1s, 2s, and 3s. Implement the following functions for the IntervalVector class:
Âˆ Make sure that the number of elements is initially 0!
Âˆ Implement the += operator. Its right-hand side argument is an unsigned integer. We
want to store an extra one of this number in the IntervalVector object, if it falls within
the closed interval [MIN,MAX].
 Example: In the case of IntervalVector<1,5> v; v+=5; v+=5; two ves are
stored in the vector.
 If the input is incorrect (it is outside the interval), throw the value in the parameter
(i.e. the wrong index) as an exception.
Âˆ Create an indexer operator for the class, which takes an unsigned value as a parameter
and returns how many of this element are stored in the class. There should be two
versions: a constant version and a version through which the stored value can be modied.
If the parameter does not fall within the interval, throw the value in the parameter as an
exception (i.e. the wrong index).
Âˆ Implement the output stream operator (). The format of the output is like this:
Implement the + operator for two IntervalVector objects, which cover exactly the same
interval. The result is an IntervalVector summing the number of elements of the two
operands.

===============================

Write an unsigned count_element template function. It should count how many times a
given element occurs in an array. It should have three template arguments. The rst template
parameter species the type of elements stored by the array (T), the second argument species
the length of the array (N), and the third argument species the type of element to search for
(K). The default value for K should be T, i.e. the type of elements stored by the array. The
function has two parameters: the rst is a pointer pointing to T, i.e. this pointer points to
an "N-sized array of elements of type T". The second parameter should be of type K. This
parameter determines which element is counted. By default, the function counts the number
of times the value in the second parameter occurs in the array and returns it. Let there be a
specialization of the function where the template parameters are T=std::string, N=5, K=char.
In this case, the total number of occurrences of the character received in the second function
parameter should be counted in all the strings stored in the array.

==================================

Write a manipulator named anonym. It anonymizes words starting with a capital letter in the
input. Anonymization means overwriting the characters of words starting with a capital letter
with * characters. A word is a string of characters with a space before and after it. The only
exception is if the word is at the beginning of the input (no other character before it) or at
the end of the input (no other character after it). No other case needs to be addressed. The
manipulator should behave as follows: the rst time it is used, anonymization is turned on, the
next time it is used, anonymization is turned o, the third time it is used, anonymization is
turned on again, and so on.

====================

Write an Exchange eector that takes an unsigned value and a string as its parameters. The
eector converts euro to forint and vice versa. The number parameter represents the amount
of money, the string represents the currency, it can be "EUR" or "HUF". The exchange rate
of the euro should be 425. That is, for an input of 100 EUR, write "42500 HUF" to the output
stream. The conversion from forint to euro should be done with integer division. That is, if the
input is 800 HUF, the output should be "1 EUR". If the string of the currency is not "HUF"
or "EUR", the output written on the stream should be "ERROR". The quotation marks are not
part of the outputs.

======================
For this task, see the initial solutions in task.cpp (after the rst #ifdef TRAITS_CAKE line).
There are two types of sugar (normal and brown sugar), two types of food size (full portion and
3
half portion), and two types of person: dietary (Dietary) and non-dietary (Normal) are given.
The tasks are as follows:
Âˆ Create two specializations for the PersonTraits template class. In both, the types
sugar_type and portion_size should be publicly dened as follows:
 For a Normal person, the sugar_type is Sugar and the portion_size is FullPortion.
 For a Dietary person, the sugar_type is BrownSugar and the portion_size is
HalfPortion.
Âˆ Create a template class called PersonalizedCake. Its rst template argument is a type
(let's call it Person) that has a public method called get_name(). This method returns
a string. The second template argument of the PersonalizedCake is a type that pub-
licly denes the types sugar_type and portion_size. The second template argument
should have a default value which is "recommended cake composition" based on the rst
parameter.
 Let the PersonalizedCake class have a public constructor with one parameter. The
type of the parameter is Person (obtained in the rst template argument). Store
this parameter as a data member.
 There should be two additional data members in the class that store the sugar type
and the portion size.
 Be able to write the class to ostream. The string returned by the get_name method
of the stored Person data member should be written to the stream (no line breaks
at the end)
 Implement a method called double calorie_intake() which uses the sugar type's
energy method and the portion size's size method to calculate the calorie intake
(the multiplication of the two values).
 Implement the > operator, which can compare two PersonalizedCake objects with
arbitrary template parameters (not just identical ones). Whichever PersonalizedCake
has the larger calorie_intake() is the larger of the two.
